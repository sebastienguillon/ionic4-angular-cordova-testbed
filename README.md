# Ionic 4 Angular Cordova Testbed

An [Ionic 4](https://ionicframework.com/docs/) Testbed with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) integration and [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework.

The purpose of this project is to test anything related to Ionic 4 and underlying frameworks or technologies, it has no particular functional purpose.

Some of the technologies tested are:

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide),
- Angular in general, but specifically [Angular 7](https://v7.angular.io/docs),
- [RxJS 6](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/),
- [Ionic Native](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/)
- Other [Cordova plugins](https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/),
- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) created with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/).

This project is an experimental testbed but I intend to use only recommended and best-practices so that it can serve as a reference repository for my other projects.
